# Nanodegree Project: MyReads

This is a simple react application. I created this for my udacity ReactJS Nanodegree Program. I used my skills to creat a front-end, which relies on REST API to communicate with the backend.

## I have created &mdash;
<br />

```bash
── src
    ├── BackToHome.js # Search page button to get back to Homepage.
    ├── Book.js # Books main template.

## Run the application &mdash;
<br />

This is a simple NodeJs application.
01. You need to install the packages required for it `npm install`
02. Run the development server `npm start`
- Or you can build it for the production `npm run build`

## Search &mdash;
<br />

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
